To compile the template to PDF execute the following sequence of commands in a shell:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
Rscript -e "library(knitr); knit('manuscript.Rnw')"
pdflatex manuscript
biber manuscript
pdflatex manuscript
pdflatex manuscript
#+END_SRC

RStudio might automatize this process but Iâ€™m not familiar with it.

Suggestions for improvements and pull requests are welcome.
